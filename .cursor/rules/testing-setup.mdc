# Testing Setup Guide

This project uses Vitest as the primary testing framework. We've moved away from Jest to align better with our Vite-based build system.

## Key Testing Files
- `vitest.config.ts` - Contains the Vitest configuration
- `src/__tests__/` - Main directory for test files
- Test files follow the naming pattern: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`

## Testing Guidelines
1. Place test files close to the components they test
2. Use `.test.tsx` extension for React component tests
3. Use `.test.ts` for utility and helper function tests
4. Include snapshot tests for UI components when appropriate

## Running Tests
- Use `npm run test` to run all tests
- Use `npm run test:watch` for watch mode during development
- Use `npm run coverage` to generate coverage reports

## Best Practices
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
- Keep test files organized alongside their corresponding components
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
